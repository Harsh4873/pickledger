# Architecture

## Production Path

```text
model/feed Actions
      |
      v
committed JSON in data/
      |
      +--> scheduled ESPN auto-grader --> committed results
      |
      +--> Profit Desk builder --> dated live decision artifacts
      |
      v
Vite static build --> GitHub Pages
```

The production viewer is intentionally static. It does not load Firebase, authenticate users, or call the optional Python backend.

## Frontend Contract

- `src/data.ts` loads every dated file listed in `data/model_cache/index.json`.
- `src/data.ts` loads every dated file listed in `data/player_props_cache/index.json`.
- `src/data.ts` loads the compact, precomputed files listed in
  `data/profit_desk/index.json`; the browser never invents a profit score from
  raw picks.
- Picks receive deterministic browser IDs so client-side ESPN grades can be stored locally.
- `src/main.ts` renders Home, Search, Rankings, Best Bets, Parlays, and the
  Profit Desk from the same pick collection plus the precomputed desk artifact.
- Rankings are calculated from committed results across all manifest dates.
- Best Bets is the heuristic daily shortlist. Profit Desk is its own tab after
  Parlays: it requires observed, fresh pricing, uses strictly prior evidence,
  applies shrinkage and an uncertainty penalty, and stakes only through its
  qualification lanes (EDGE 1.0u, VALUE 0.5u) — otherwise it publishes 0u and
  says so. See `docs/PROFIT_DESK.md`.
- The Refresh button checks ESPN for pending games and stores temporary local grades. The scheduled grader remains authoritative because it writes results into repository JSON.

## Writer Contract

The model-cache, player-prop, external-feed, and auto-grade workflows share the `pick-cache-writer` concurrency group. Only one writer can modify `data/` at a time.

Model and feed refreshes:

1. Generate JSON without Firestore writes.
2. Reset to the latest `main`.
3. Merge the generated payload.
4. Attach real pregame market prices (`scripts/market_odds.py`): both
   moneylines, total over/under prices, spreads, and MLB first-5-innings
   markets from the ESPN scoreboard/prop feeds. Scraped picks keep their own
   executable odds and gain a verifiable two-sided baseline; in-house model
   picks with assumed prices have them replaced by the real observed price
   for their exact market and line. Captured pregame prices are preserved by
   the merge layer once a game goes live.
4. Preserve existing `result`, `start_time`, and `game_start_time` fields for matching picks.
5. Commit and push as the triggering GitHub actor.

For the audited in-house team-model buckets (`mlb_new`, `mlb_first_five`,
`mlb_inning`, `fifa_world_cup`, and `nba_summer`), the model refresh also
stores an immutable first-publication/revision record in
`data/calibration/team_prop_pregame_ledger.json`. Certification requires a
trusted per-pick publication timestamp earlier than the scheduled start.
Legacy cache rows remain visible but are not promoted into certified evidence.

The certified ledger separates three concepts:

- forecast evaluation, which includes certified PASS/LEAN/BET outcomes;
- market/ROI evaluation, which additionally requires observed executable odds;
- calibration training, which additionally requires explicit eligibility and
  continues to exclude FIFA.

`scripts/team_prop_model_evaluator.py` reads only this ledger and reports
chronological metrics by model version and market, including Brier score, log
loss, calibration bins, verified-price ROI, market benchmarks, and retained
feature-contract coverage.

The universal probability calibrator has a versioned training contract. Rows
whose probabilities are owned by the player-prop ML policy remain available
for evaluation but are explicitly ineligible to train the separate shared
Platt layer. A training-contract change invalidates the prior mapping and
forces evaluation against a clean identity champion.

`scripts/cache_manifest.py` updates the dated-cache manifest whenever model or feed caches are written or merged.

## Deployment Contract

`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` runs on every push to `main`. It first checks that today's model and player-prop caches are complete. Incomplete daily refreshes defer deployment without failing; ready data is built, copied into `dist/`, and deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Verification

```bash
npm run build
npm run typecheck
python3 -m pytest tests/smoke/test_static_viewer.py -q
python3 scripts/auto_grade_picks.py
```

Visual browser inspection is intentionally left to the repository owner.
