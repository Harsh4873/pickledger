# Unattended daily production refresh, run from cron on the owner's machine.
#
# WHY THIS RUNS LOCALLY AND NOT IN ACTIONS
# Scores24 and Forebet Cloudflare-403 every GitHub-hosted runner IP, which is
# why the runbook makes them local-only. A scheduled workflow — or any
# cloud-hosted trigger — cannot publish them no matter how it is invoked. Only a
# host with a non-datacenter IP and Camoufox can, so the scraper half of the
# daily refresh has to live on a box like this one.
#
# It also covers the failure this was actually built for: GitHub's `schedule:`
# triggers are best-effort and have been unreliable on this repo — 2026-07-25
# and 2026-07-28 saw no writer fire at all, and 2026-07-27's was cancelled on
# the shared concurrency group. Each time the site silently served the previous
# day because deploy readiness (correctly) refused to promote stale data.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
# This automates the mechanical half of `/refresh`: publish, dispatch, deploy,
# verify. It cannot diagnose a novel defect the way the full runbook does — when
# it reports anything other than HEALTHY, run `/refresh` and read the log.
#
# Usage:
#   daily_local_refresh.sh              # full run
#   daily_local_refresh.sh --dry-run    # verify wiring, take no action
